    "   - You can use `sys.getrefcount(numbers)`, but keep in mind that passing in the object to getrefcount() increases the reference count by 1.\n",
    "- In any case, if the object is still required to hang around in your code, its reference count is greater than 0. \n",
    "- Once it drops to 0, the object has a specific deallocation function that is called which “frees” the memory so that other objects can use it."

    "\n",
    "- The GIL is a solution to the common problem of dealing with shared resources, like memory in a computer. \n",
    "- When two threads try to modify the same resource at the same time, they can step on each other’s toes.\n",
    "- The end result can be a garbled mess where neither of the threads ends up with what they wanted.\n",
    "- Python’s GIL accomplishes this by locking the entire interpreter, meaning that it’s not possible for another thread to step on the current one. \n",
    "- When CPython handles memory, it uses the GIL to ensure that it does so safely.\n",
    "- The GIL is a single lock on the **interpreter itself** which adds a rule that execution of any Python bytecode requires acquiring the interpreter lock. \n",
    "- This prevents deadlocks (as there is only one lock) and doesn’t introduce much performance overhead. But it effectively makes any **CPU-bound Python program single-threaded.**"
