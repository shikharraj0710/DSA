    "**List**\n",
    "- ***Pros***\n",
    "  - Built upon blocks of contiguous memory (the items are stored next to each other in memory)\n",
    "  - Fast access to Random elements (arr[6])\n",
    "- ***Cons***\n",
    "  - If your stack grows bigger than the block of memory that currently holds it, then Python needs to do some memory allocations. This can lead to some `.append()` calls taking much longer than other ones.\n",
    "  - If you use `.insert()` to add an element to your stack at a position other than the end, it can take much longer. This is not normally something you would do to a stack, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "**collections.deque**\n",
    "- The collections module contains deque, which is useful for creating Python stacks. deque is pronounced “deck” and stands for “double-ended queue.”\n",
    "- In a linked list structure, each entry is stored in its own memory block and has a reference to the next entry in the list.\n",
    "- A doubly linked list is just the same, except that each entry has references to both the previous and the next entry in the list. This allows you to easily add nodes to either end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Pros***\n",
    "  - Constant-time addition and removal of entries onto a stack.\n",
    "- ***Cons***\n",
    "  - Getting myDeque[3] is slower than it was for a list, because Python needs to walk through each node of the list to get to the third element. Fortunately, you rarely want to do random indexing or slicing on a stack. Most operations on a stack are either push or pop.\n",
    "  - The constant time `.append()` and `.pop()` operations make deque an excellent choice for implementing a Python stack if your code doesn’t use threading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threading**\n",
    "- You should never use `list` for any data structure that can be accessed by multiple threads. `list` is not *thread-safe*.\n",
    "- `deque` is a little more complex, however. If you read the documentation for deque, it clearly states that both the .append() and .pop() operations are atomic, meaning that they won’t be interrupted by a different thread.\n",
    "- So if you restrict yourself to using only .append() and .pop(), then you will be thread safe.\n",
    "- The concern with using deque in a threaded environment is that there are other methods in that class, and those are not specifically designed to be atomic, nor are they thread safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**queue.LifoQueue**\n",
    "- Unlike deque, LifoQueue is designed to be fully thread-safe. All of its methods are safe to use in a threaded environment. \n",
    "- It also adds optional time-outs to its operations which can frequently be a must-have feature in threaded programs.\n"
